project_blurb: "[Folding@home]({{ project_url }}) is a distributed computing project for simulating protein dynamics, including the process of protein folding and the movements of proteins implicated in a variety of diseases. It brings together citizen scientists who volunteer to run simulations of protein dynamics on their personal computers. Insights from this data are helping scientists to better understand biology, and providing new opportunities for developing therapeutics."

  This image sets up the Folding@home client. The interface is available at `http://your-ip:7396`.
  
  The built-in webserver provides very basic control (ie. GPUs are only active when set to `Medium` or higher). For more fine grained control of individual devices, you can use the FAHControl app on a different device and connect remotely via port `36330` (no password).
  
  There are a couple of minor issues with the webgui:
  - If you get an "ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE" error when trying to access via IP, it's most likely due to a clash of cookies/cache. Try opening in an incgnito window.
  - If you're getting a constant refresh of the window but no display of info, try a force refresh via `shft-F5` or `ctrl-F5`.

  ## GPU Hardware Acceleration
  
  ### Nvidia
  
  Hardware acceleration users for Nvidia will need to install the container runtime provided by Nvidia on their host, instructions can be found here:
  https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker
  We automatically add the necessary environment variable that will utilise all the features available on a GPU on the host. Once nvidia-docker is installed on your host you will need to re/create the docker container with the nvidia container runtime `--runtime=nvidia` and add an environment variable `-e NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=all` (can also be set to a specific gpu's UUID, this can be discovered by running `nvidia-smi --query-gpu=gpu_name,gpu_uuid --format=csv` ). NVIDIA automatically mounts the GPU and drivers from your host into the foldingathome docker container.
